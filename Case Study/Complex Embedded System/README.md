# **FITNESS TRACKER WATCH** 
# INTRODUCTION

Fitness tracker watch is a device for monitoring and tracking fitness-related metrics such as distance walked or run, calorie consumption, and in some cases heartbeat. It is a type of wearable computer. The term is now primarily used for smartwatches that are synced, in many cases wirelessly, to a computer or smartphone for long-term data tracking.

# REQUIREMENTS
## High level requirements:
|RID	|DESCRIPTION |
|---- |----|
|HLR1	|To measure heart rate for user |

|HLR3	|To detect and count steps of the user while walking |
|HLR4	|Alert the user for rise in skin tempreture |
|HLR5	|Respond to the Gesture of user |

## Low Level Requirement:
|RID	|DESCRIPTION |
|---- |----|
|LLR1	|Keeping track of time |
|LLR2	|Indicating Baterry Percentage|
|LLR3	|Find My Device|
|LLR4	|Alarm feature|
|LLR5	|Tacks Sleep Time|

### Microcontroller

* A microcontroller (MCU for microcontroller unit) is a small computer on a single metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) integrated circuit (IC) chip. 
* A microcontroller contains one or more CPUs (processor cores) along with memory and programmable input/output peripherals.
* For fitness tracker low power microcontoller are used (MSP430).

### Memory Chip

* A memory chip is an integrated circuit made out of millions of capacitors and transistors that can store data or can be used to process code.
* Memory chips can hold memory either temporarily through random access memory (RAM), or permanently through read only memory (ROM). 

### Voltage regulator

* A voltage regulator is a circuit that creates and maintains a fixed output voltage, irrespective of changes to the input voltage or load conditions

### Gesture Sensor

* Gesture sensors can instruct the watch to do certain task.
* For example, if a wrist is flicked twice, the call will be disconnected or when the hand is moved in circles the stopwatch will start.
*  Detecting these pre-fed motion is the job of gesture sensors.

### Humidity Sensor

* A humidity sensor is an electronic device that measures the humidity in its environment and converts its findings into a corresponding electrical signal

### Heart Beat Measurement sensor

* Modern fitness tracker use a flashing green light to measure  heart rate from  wrist.
*  Spectroscopy tells us that blood absorbs green light because red and green are opposite each other on the colour wheel. 
* The rear of the fitness tracker contains an optical sensor to detect the reflected light.

### Blood pressure Monitoring

* The Blood Pressure Sensor is a non-invasive sensor designed to measure human blood pressure.

### Tempreture Sensor

* It helps measure your body or skin temperature to keep a constant check on your health.

### Accelerometer

* An accelerometer is a device that measures the vibration, or acceleration of motion of a structure.

### Step measurement Sensor

* It Keeps Record Of The Step walked by the user through the measurment of Accelerometer.

### Bluetooth

* Bluetooth technology allows devices to communicate with each other without cables or wires

### LCD

* LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. 
* It is used to display all the measured data.
