# **GREENHOUSE MONITORING AND AUTOMATION SYSTEM**

# INTRODUCTION

* Greenhouse, also called glasshouse, building designed for the protection of tender or out-of-season plants against excessive cold or heat

* A green house is where plants such as flowers and vegetables are grown. Greenhouses warmup during the day when sun-rays penetrates through it, which heats the plant, soil and structure.

* Green houses help to protect crops from many diseases, particularly those that are soil borne and splash onto plants in the rain. 

* Greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon and beneficial to human being. Numerous farmers fail to get good profits from the greenhouse crops for the reason that they canâ€™t manage two essential factors, which determines plant growth as well as productivity.

* Green house temperature should not go below a certain degree, High humidity can result to crop transpiration, condensation of water vapour on various greenhouse surfaces, and water evaporation from the humid soil.

* To overcome such challenges, this greenhouse monitoring and automation system comes to rescue. This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a various sensors for greenhouse environment to monitoring and controlling.

# OBJECTIVES:

 The main objective of this project is to Monitor and Control the Greenhouse by means of measuring and maintaining volumetric water content in soil, temperature ,humidity and finally display all relevant data in LCD 

# SWOT ANALYSIS

## STRENGTHS

* Reliability of crop increases in green house cultivation.
* Expands your growing season.
* Expanding the variety among your produce.
* Minimize external threats to your crop.

## WEAKNESS

* High upfront and operating expenses.
* Lack of pollination.

## OPPORTUNITIES

* Advancement in Technology.
* Improvements in automation system.

## THREATS

* Failure of Power supply leads to shut down of whole system.

# 4W's And 1H
