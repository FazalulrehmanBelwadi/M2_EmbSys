# **GREENHOUSE AUTOMATION SYSTEM**

# INTRODUCTION

* Crop cultivation has been around for a longtime. It plays a crucial role in the continuous
development of human civilization. 
* Traditional crop cultivation requires a tremendous amount of
hard work and attention and there are several disadvantages in implementing traditional
cultivation techniques:
  * Weather dependent factors: plants growth and development are primarily governed by the
weather conditions.
  * Pests and diseases: plants growing under traditional cultivation technique 
are significantly affected by pests and diseases.

* A greenhouse allows the growers to produce plants in places where the climate would otherwise be unfeasible for the growing of plants. 
* The production of crop plants is independent of the geographic location and the time of the year.
* The greenhouse also provides shelter for the plants, protects them from harsh weather conditions, insects and diseases.
* A green House System is requrired.
